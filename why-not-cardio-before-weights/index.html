Purdy’s Wharf</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you one of those people who start their workout with cardio and then move onto weight lifting? If yes, then you might want to reconsider your fitness routine. While cardio is an essential part of any workout, doing it before weight lifting can lead to negative consequences. In this article, we will explain why not cardio before weights is a better approach to achieve your fitness goals.</p><h2>Understanding the Pain Points of Why Not Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Before we dive into why not cardio before weights, let's understand the pain points related to this approach. Many people prefer to start their workout with cardio because it helps them warm up and get their heart rate up. However, doing cardio first can reduce your energy levels and make your weight lifting less effective. Moreover, it can also increase your risk of injury as your muscles are already tired from cardio.</p><h2>Answering the Target of Why Not Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>The reason why not cardio before weights is that cardio can deplete your glycogen stores, which are essential for muscle growth and strength. When you do cardio before weight lifting, your glycogen stores are already used up, making it harder for you to lift weights and build muscle. Moreover, cardio can also increase the production of cortisol, a stress hormone that breaks down muscle tissue and reduces muscle growth.</p><p>On the other hand, weight lifting uses your glycogen stores to fuel your muscles, making it easier for you to lift heavier weights and build more muscle. By doing weight lifting first, you can maximize your muscle growth and strength, leading to more effective workouts and better results.</p><h2>Summary of Why Not Cardio Before Weights and Related Keywords</h2><p>In summary, doing cardio before weight lifting can reduce your energy levels, increase your risk of injury, deplete your glycogen stores, and reduce muscle growth. On the other hand, doing weight lifting before cardio can help you maximize your muscle growth and strength, leading to more effective workouts and better results. Therefore, it is better to prioritize weight lifting over cardio for better fitness results.</p><h2>Why Not Cardio Before Weights: Personal Experience and Explanation</h2><p>As someone who used to do cardio before weight lifting, I can attest to the negative effects of this approach. I often found myself tired and lacking energy during weight lifting, making it challenging to lift heavier weights and push myself to the limit. Moreover, I also suffered from muscle soreness and fatigue, which made it harder for me to maintain a consistent workout routine.</p><p>However, when I switched to weight lifting before cardio, I noticed a significant improvement in my energy levels and muscle growth. By prioritizing weight lifting, I was able to lift heavier weights and push myself to the limit, leading to better fitness results. Moreover, I also experienced less muscle soreness and fatigue, making it easier for me to maintain a consistent workout routine.</p><p>Therefore, based on my personal experience, I highly recommend prioritizing weight lifting over cardio for better fitness results.</p><h2>The Negative Effects of Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, doing cardio before weight lifting can have negative effects on your fitness routine. Here are some of the negative effects of cardio before weights:</p><h3>Depletion of Glycogen Stores</h3><p>Cardio can deplete your glycogen stores, which are essential for muscle growth and strength. When you do cardio before weight lifting, your glycogen stores are already used up, making it harder for you to lift weights and build muscle.</p><h3>Increase in Cortisol Levels</h3><p>Cardio can increase the production of cortisol, a stress hormone that breaks down muscle tissue and reduces muscle growth. When you do cardio before weight lifting, your cortisol levels are already elevated, which can reduce your muscle growth and strength.</p><h4>Difficulty in Lifting Heavier Weights</h4><p>Cardio before weight lifting can reduce your energy levels and make it harder for you to lift heavier weights. As a result, you may not be able to push yourself to the limit and achieve your fitness goals.</p><h2>Question and Answer about Why Not Cardio Before Weights</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I do cardio after weight lifting?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do cardio after weight lifting. Doing cardio after weight lifting can help you burn more fat and improve your cardiovascular endurance.</p><p><strong>Q: How long should I wait after weight lifting to do cardio?</strong></p><p>A: You should wait at least 20-30 minutes after weight lifting to do cardio. This will give your body enough time to recover and replenish your glycogen stores for optimal performance during cardio.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I skip cardio altogether?</strong></p><p>A: No, you should not skip cardio altogether. Cardio is an essential part of any workout routine, and it can help you improve your cardiovascular endurance, burn fat, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the best type of cardio to do after weight lifting?</strong></p><p>A: The best type of cardio to do after weight lifting is low-intensity steady-state cardio (LISS). LISS cardio involves doing low-intensity exercises like walking, jogging, or cycling for a longer duration to burn fat and improve cardiovascular endurance.</p><h2>Conclusion of Why Not Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>In conclusion, doing cardio before weight lifting can have negative effects on your fitness routine, such as reducing your energy levels, depleting your glycogen stores, and reducing muscle growth. Therefore, it is better to prioritize weight lifting over cardio for better fitness results. However, it is important to remember that cardio is an essential part of any workout routine, and you should not skip it altogether. By following the right approach, you can achieve your fitness goals and improve your overall health and well-being.</p></article>
