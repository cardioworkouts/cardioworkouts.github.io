I didn't know where to start or what exercises to do. That's when I discovered jumping jacks. This simple exercise is a great way to get your heart rate up and get your body moving.</p><p>Jumping jacks are a classic cardio exercise that have been around for decades. They involve jumping up and down while simultaneously moving your arms up and down. This exercise is great for targeting your core and getting your heart rate up quickly.</p><p>To do jumping jacks, start by standing with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump up and spread your legs out to the sides while simultaneously moving your arms up and out to the sides. Then jump back to the starting position, bringing your legs and arms back together. Repeat for 20-30 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Repeat for a total of 5-10 sets.</p><p><h2>Target: High Knees</h2></p><p>Another great exercise for a 20 minute cardio workout for beginners is high knees. This exercise is a great way to target your lower body and get your heart rate up.</p><p>To do high knees, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.

Repeat for 20-30 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Repeat for a total of 5-10 sets.</p><p><h3>Target: Burpees</h3></p><p>Burpees are a great exercise for targeting your entire body and getting your heart rate up quickly. They can be challenging, but they are also very effective at burning calories and toning your muscles.</p><p>To do a burpee, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend down and place your hands on the ground, then jump your feet back into a plank position. From there, jump your feet back in towards your hands and stand up. Repeat for 20-30 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Repeat for a total of 5-10 sets.</p><p><h4>Target: Mountain Climbers</h4></p><p>Mountain climbers are another great exercise for targeting your core and getting your heart rate up quickly. They are also a great way to improve your balance and coordination.</p><p>To do mountain climbers, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Bring your right knee up towards your chest, then quickly switch and bring your left knee up towards your chest. Continue alternating legs, moving as quickly as you can while still maintaining control. Repeat for 20-30 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Repeat for a total of 5-10 sets.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q:</b> How often should I do a 20 minute cardio workout for beginners?</p><p><b>A:</b> It's recommended to do cardio exercise at least 3-4 times per week for optimal results.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Do I need any equipment for a 20 minute cardio workout for beginners?</p><p><b>A:</b> No, you don't need any equipment for this workout.
