Row one arm up towards your chest, keeping your elbow close to your body. Lower the weight back down and repeat on the other side.</p><p><strong>Russian Twist:</strong> Sit on the ground with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell with both hands and lean back slightly. Twist your torso to the right, tapping the dumbbell on the ground. Twist to the left and repeat.</p><h4>Tips for Creating a Workout Plan</h4><p>Now that you have some easy weight workouts for beginners to try, it's important to create a workout plan that fits your goals and schedule.
