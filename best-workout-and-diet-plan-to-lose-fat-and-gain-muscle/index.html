It should also include a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to provide your body with the necessary nutrients.</p><p>Here is an example of a diet plan:</p><p>- Breakfast: Oatmeal with berries and almonds</p><p>- Snack: Greek yogurt with sliced banana</p><p>- Lunch: Grilled chicken breast with mixed vegetables</p><p>- Snack: Protein shake with almond milk and berries</p><p>- Dinner: Grilled salmon with brown rice and steamed broccoli</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q: Can I lose fat and gain muscle at the same time?</b></p><p>A: Yes, it is possible to lose fat and gain muscle simultaneously with the right workout and diet plan.</p><p><b>Q: How much protein should I consume per day?</b></p><p>A: You should aim to consume 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.</p><p><b>Q: Should I do cardio or strength training first?</b></p><p>A: It depends on your goals. If your primary goal is to lose fat, then you should do cardio first. If your primary goal is to gain muscle, then you should do strength training first.</p><p><b>Q: How long does it take to see results?</b></p><p>A: It depends on various factors, such as your starting point, the intensity of your workouts, and your diet. However, you can expect to see significant changes in your body composition within a few months.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Workout and Diet Plan to Lose Fat and Gain Muscle</h2></p><p>Losing fat and gaining muscle simultaneously requires a combination of strength training and a high protein, low-calorie diet.
