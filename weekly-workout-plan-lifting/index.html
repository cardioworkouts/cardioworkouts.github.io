The goal is to increase strength, build muscle, and improve overall fitness. A well-designed program should include a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups, as well as adequate rest and recovery time.</p><p>There are many different types of weekly workout plans, including full-body workouts, split routines, and powerlifting programs.
