For more intense workouts, they recommend at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week.</p><p>So, how long should an individual aerobic workout last? Ideally, each session should last at least 30 minutes to get the most cardiovascular and health benefits. However, if you're just starting out, it's okay to start with shorter sessions and gradually work your way up to longer ones.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>When I first started working out, I could only handle about 10 minutes of aerobic exercise before feeling exhausted. However, as I continued to exercise regularly, I was able to increase my endurance and workout for longer periods of time. Now, I aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per session.</p><p><h2>Tips for Choosing the Right Duration</h2></p><p>1. Start with shorter sessions and gradually work your way up to longer ones.</p><p>2. Listen to your body and take breaks when needed.</p><p>3.

I enjoy trying new exercises and classes, as it keeps things interesting and challenging. I also like to set achievable goals for myself, such as running a 5K or mastering a new yoga pose.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Can I do aerobic exercise every day?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do aerobic exercise every day, but it's important to listen to your body and take breaks when needed.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I know if I'm working out too much?</strong></p><p>A: If you're experiencing pain or fatigue that doesn't go away with rest, you may be overdoing it.
