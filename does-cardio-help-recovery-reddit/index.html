Cardio is an excellent way to improve your cardiovascular health, burn calories, and reduce stress levels. But the question remains, does cardio help with recovery?</p><p>The short answer is yes, cardio can help with recovery. Cardiovascular exercise increases blood flow to your muscles, which can help them recover faster. Additionally, cardio can help remove waste products from your muscles that can cause soreness and fatigue.

Additionally, cardio can help remove waste products such as lactic acid that can cause soreness and fatigue.</p><p>Personally, I have found that doing low-intensity cardio such as walking or cycling has helped me recover faster after a workout.

If you are new to fitness, it is best to start with low-intensity cardio such as walking or cycling for 20-30 minutes after a workout. As you progress, you can increase the intensity and duration of your cardio sessions. </p><p>It is also important to listen to your body and not overdo it. Doing too much cardio can lead to overtraining, which can hinder your recovery. If you feel fatigued or sore, it is best to take a day off from cardio or do low-intensity cardio instead of high-intensity cardio.</p><p><h3>The Best Types of Cardio for Recovery Reddit</h3></p><p>Not all types of cardio are created equal when it comes to recovery.
