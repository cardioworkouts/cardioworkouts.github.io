These exercises are low-impact, easy to perform, and help you build endurance, burn calories, and improve your overall health. </p><p><h2>Cardio Exercises</h2></p><p>Cardio exercises are perfect for beginners because they are low-impact and easy to perform. These exercises help you burn calories, improve your cardiovascular health, and boost your mood. Some examples of cardio exercises include walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, and dancing.</p><p>When I first started my fitness journey, I started with walking. I would walk around the block for 30 minutes every day. As I got more comfortable, I increased the time and distance. Walking is a great way to get started because it's low-impact and easy on the joints.</p><p><h2>Strength Training</h2></p><p>Strength training is another great workout for weight loss beginners. These exercises help you build muscle, boost your metabolism, and burn more calories. Some examples of strength training exercises include bodyweight exercises, weightlifting, and resistance band exercises.</p><p>When I first started strength training, I used my body weight to perform exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups. As I got stronger, I started using weights to increase the intensity of my workouts. Strength training can be intimidating for beginners, but it's a great way to build muscle and burn fat.</p><p><h3>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h3></p><p>HIIT is a type of workout that combines short bursts of intense exercise with periods of rest. These workouts are perfect for weight loss beginners because they are short, intense, and effective. HIIT workouts help you burn fat, increase your metabolism, and improve your cardiovascular health.</p><p>When I first started doing HIIT workouts, I used workout videos on YouTube. These videos gave me the structure and guidance I needed to get started. HIIT workouts are challenging, but they are worth it. They help you burn fat, increase your metabolism, and build endurance.</p><p><h4>How to get started</h4></p><p>If you're new to the fitness world, it's important to start slow and work your way up. You don't want to overdo it and risk injury. Start with 30-minute workouts, three times a week, and gradually increase the intensity and duration. It's also important to find workouts that you enjoy. If you don't like running, try cycling or dancing instead.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Workouts for Weight Loss Beginners</h2></p><p>Starting a new fitness journey can be overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.
