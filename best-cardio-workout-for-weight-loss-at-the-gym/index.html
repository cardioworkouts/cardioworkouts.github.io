Cycling also strengthens your lower body muscles, including your glutes, quads, and calves.</p><p>When I started cycling, I noticed that I burned a significant amount of calories in a short amount of time. Cycling also helped me build endurance, and I was able to cycle longer distances without getting tired.</p><h3>How to Incorporate Cycling into Your Gym Routine</h3><p>Most gyms have stationary bikes that you can use for your cycling workouts. Start with a 10-15 minute session and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you get more comfortable. You can also join a cycling class or use a cycling app to make your workouts more challenging and enjoyable.</p><h4>Running for Weight Loss</h4><p>Running is a popular cardio workout for weight loss as it burns a significant amount of calories and improves your cardiovascular health. Running also strengthens your lower body muscles, including your calves, quads, and glutes.</p><p>When I started running, I found it challenging, but as I continued to practice, I noticed that my endurance improved, and I was able to run longer distances without getting tired. Running also helped me clear my mind and reduce stress.</p><h4>How to Incorporate Running into Your Gym Routine</h4><p>Most gyms have treadmills that you can use for your running workouts.
