First and foremost, they're a great way to get your heart rate up and burn calories.

You can do a quick workout at home, in the park, or even in your office during a break.</p><p><h3>Factors That Affect Calorie Burn During Cardio Workouts</h3></p><p>The number of calories you burn during a 15-minute cardio workout will depend on several factors. These include:</p><p><ul><li>Your weight</li><li>The type of exercise you're doing</li><li>The intensity of your workout</li></ul></p><p>Heavier individuals tend to burn more calories during exercise than lighter individuals.
