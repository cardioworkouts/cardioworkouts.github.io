Lower your body as if you are sitting down in a chair, keeping your knees behind your toes.</p><p>4. Push through your heels to stand back up.</p><p>5. Repeat for your desired number of reps.</p><p><h2>Other Great Exercises to Do in the Gym</h2></p><p>While the squat is a great exercise to do in the gym, there are many other exercises that can help you reach your fitness goals.
