Additionally, some people may find that doing cardio after strength training interferes with their muscle-building goals, as cardio can burn calories and decrease muscle mass.</p><h2>Answer to Is Cardio After Strength Training Bad</h2><p>The answer to this question is: it depends. Doing cardio after strength training can be beneficial for some people, while it may not be suitable for others. It's important to consider your fitness goals and needs when deciding whether to do cardio after strength training. For example, if you're looking to improve your cardiovascular endurance, doing cardio after strength training may be beneficial. However, if you're focusing on building muscle mass, doing cardio after strength training may not be the best option.</p><h2>Summary of Main Points</h2><p>In summary, doing cardio after strength training is not necessarily bad for your body.
