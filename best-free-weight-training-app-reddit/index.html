It offers a wide variety of exercises, as well as the ability to customize your workout plan based on your fitness goals and level of experience.</p><p>One of the standout features of JEFIT is its social aspect.

JEFIT allows you to input your weight, body measurements, and workout history to create a comprehensive fitness profile.</p><h2>StrongLifts 5x5: Build Strength and Muscle</h2><p>If your goal is to build strength and muscle, StrongLifts 5x5 is a great option. This app focuses on compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses to help you build a solid foundation of strength.</p><p>The app guides you through each workout, telling you exactly what exercises to do and how many sets and reps to complete. It also includes a timer to help you rest between sets.</p><p>One unique feature of StrongLifts 5x5 is its emphasis on progressive overload. This means that you gradually increase the weight you lift over time, which can help you avoid hitting a plateau in your progress.</p><h2>Fitbod: Personalized Workouts Based on Your Fitness Data</h2><p>Fitbod is another highly rated free weight training app that offers personalized workouts based on your fitness data. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze your workout history and create a customized workout plan that will challenge you without pushing you too hard.</p><p>One of the standout features of Fitbod is its ability to provide alternative exercises if you don't have access to a certain piece of equipment. This can be especially helpful if you're working out at home or in a gym with limited equipment.</p><p>Fitbod also offers a social aspect, allowing you to connect with friends and other users to share workouts and progress.</p><h3>How to Make the Most of Your Free Weight Training App</h3><p>Now that you know some of the best free weight training apps Reddit users recommend, how can you make the most of them?
