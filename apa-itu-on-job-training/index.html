Ask Questions</h4></p><p>If you're not sure about something, ask! Your supervisor or mentor is there to help you, and they want you to succeed.</p><p><h2>FAQs: </h2></p><p><h3>Q. What is the difference between on job training and traditional training programs?</h3></p><p>A. Traditional training programs take place before an employee starts their job, while on job training takes place while the employee is doing their job.</p><p><h3>Q.
