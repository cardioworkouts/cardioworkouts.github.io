Cardio or weights first, Cardio</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you someone who likes to hit the gym for a cardio session before moving on to weight training? Or are you someone who believes that weight training should always come before cardio? The question of whether to do weight training after cardio is a common one, and it can be confusing for many people. In this blog post, we will explore the topic in detail and help you make an informed decision.</p><h2>Pain Points of Should You Do Weight Training After Cardio</h2><p>If you are someone who is looking to build muscle and lose fat, you may wonder whether doing cardio before weight training will help or hinder your progress. Similarly, if you are someone who enjoys cardio and wants to improve your stamina, you may wonder whether doing weight training after cardio will be beneficial or detrimental.</p><h2>Answer to Should You Do Weight Training After Cardio</h2><p>The answer to whether you should do weight training after cardio depends on your fitness goals. If your primary goal is to build muscle, it is generally recommended that you do weight training before cardio. This is because weight training requires more energy and focus, and doing it when you are fresh will allow you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps. Additionally, doing cardio before weight training can deplete your energy levels and make it harder for you to lift as heavy as you would like.</p><p>On the other hand, if your primary goal is to improve your cardiovascular fitness, you may want to do cardio before weight training. This is because cardio will warm up your body and prepare your muscles for weight training. Additionally, doing cardio after weight training can be beneficial for your recovery, as it can help flush out lactic acid and reduce muscle soreness.</p><p>It is also worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Some people may find that they perform better when they do weight training after cardio, while others may prefer the opposite. Ultimately, the best approach is the one that works best for you and helps you achieve your fitness goals.</p><h2>Summary of Should You Do Weight Training After Cardio</h2><p>In summary, whether you should do weight training after cardio depends on your fitness goals.

Additionally, doing cardio after weight training can leave me feeling exhausted and make it harder for me to perform at my best.</p><h2>Benefits of Doing Weight Training After Cardio</h2><p>While it is generally recommended that you do weight training before cardio, there are some benefits to doing it the other way around. For example, doing cardio before weight training can help warm up your muscles and prepare your body for the workout ahead. Additionally, doing cardio after weight training can be beneficial for your recovery, as it can help flush out lactic acid and reduce muscle soreness.</p><h3>How to Make the Most of Your Workout</h3><p>If you are someone who likes to do cardio before weight training, there are some things you can do to make the most of your workout. For example, you may want to do a shorter cardio session before weight training, or choose low-impact exercises that won't tire you out too much. Additionally, you can try to focus on your form and technique during weight training, even if you are feeling fatigued from cardio.</p><h4>How to Structure Your Workout</h4><p>If you decide to do weight training after cardio, it is important to structure your workout in a way that maximizes your results. For example, you may want to start with a short cardio warm-up, followed by weight training exercises that target your larger muscle groups. You can then finish your workout with a longer cardio session to help flush out lactic acid and reduce muscle soreness.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Should You Do Weight Training After Cardio</h2><p>As someone who has been working out for several years, I have tried both approaches - doing weight training after cardio and doing cardio after weight training.
