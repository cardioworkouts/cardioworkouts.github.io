Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your heels, and hold for as long as you can.</p><p><h4>How to Make It Easier:</h4></p><p>If you're new to planks, you can start with a modified plank by keeping your knees on the ground. You can also do side planks by turning onto one side and lifting your body off the ground with one arm.</p><p><h3>4. Squats</h3></p><p>Squats are a great lower body exercise that targets your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. To do a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position.</p><p><h4>How to Make It Easier:</h4></p><p>If you're new to squats, you can start with chair squats by sitting down onto a chair and standing back up. You can also hold onto a chair or a wall for balance.</p><p><h2>Staying Motivated</h2></p><p>Here are some tips for staying motivated when working out at home:</p><p><b>1. Set Goals:</b> Set specific, achievable goals for yourself, such as doing 20 push-ups or running a mile in under 10 minutes.</p><p><b>2. Track Your Progress:</b> Keep track of your workouts and progress, either in a journal or using a fitness app.</p><p><b>3. Find a Workout Buddy:</b> Find a friend or family member to work out with, either in person or virtually.</p><p><b>4.
