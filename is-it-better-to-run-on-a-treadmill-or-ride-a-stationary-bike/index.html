Finally, listen to your body and adjust the intensity and duration of your exercise according to your abilities and limitations.</p><p><h2>My Personal Experience</h2></p><p>When I first started exercising, I would only run on a treadmill because I thought it was the only way to get a good workout. However, I eventually tried riding a stationary bike and found that it was a great low-impact exercise that still challenged me.
