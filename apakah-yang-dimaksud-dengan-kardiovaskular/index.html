These symptoms can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise.</p><p>So, what is kardiovaskular? Simply put, it refers to the health of the heart and blood vessels. This includes everything from the arteries that carry blood away from the heart to the veins that bring blood back to the heart. Kardiovaskular health is essential for maintaining proper blood flow throughout the body, which in turn helps to keep all of our organs and tissues healthy.</p><p>In order to maintain good kardiovaskular health, it's important to adopt healthy lifestyle habits.
