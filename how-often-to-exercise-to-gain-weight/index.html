I started working out every day, hoping to see results quickly. Unfortunately, I only ended up feeling exhausted and discouraged. Eventually, I learned that working out too much can be counterproductive and hinder muscle growth. I started working out three times a week, focusing on strength training exercises, and saw significant progress in my weight gain journey.
