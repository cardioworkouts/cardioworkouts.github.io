This is because the high-intensity intervals in interval training can help you burn calories and fat, while the periods of rest or low-intensity exercise can help you build muscle.</p><p>Another benefit of interval training is that it can help you save time.

This makes it easier to fit exercise into your busy schedule.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Interval Training and Muscle Building</h2><p>I started doing interval training a few months ago, and I've definitely seen an improvement in my muscle tone and strength. Before I started interval training, I was doing a lot of steady-state cardio, but I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. Once I started incorporating high-intensity intervals into my workout routine, I started seeing significant improvements in my muscle tone and strength. I also found that I had more energy throughout the day and was able to focus better at work.</p><h2>How to Incorporate Interval Training into Your Workout Routine</h2><p>If you're interested in incorporating interval training into your workout routine, there are several things you can do. One option is to do a high-intensity interval workout, such as sprinting or jumping jacks, followed by a period of rest or low-intensity exercise, such as walking or jogging. You can also try incorporating interval training into your weightlifting routine by doing a set of high-intensity reps followed by a set of low-intensity reps.</p><h2>Common Misconceptions About Interval Training and Muscle Building</h2><p>One common misconception about interval training is that it's only for cardio. While it's true that interval training can be great for improving your cardiovascular health, it's also a great way to build muscle. Another misconception is that you have to do high-intensity intervals for a long time to see results. However, even short bursts of high-intensity exercise can be effective for building muscle.</p><h2>Conclusion of Does Interval Training Build Muscle</h2><p>In conclusion, interval training is a great way to build muscle and improve your overall fitness. By incorporating high-intensity intervals into your workout routine, you can see significant improvements in your muscle tone and strength.
