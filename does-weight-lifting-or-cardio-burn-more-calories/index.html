<meta name="description" content="Dr Oen Blog How Many Calories Do You Burn Lifting WeightsAre you someone who is looking to shed a few extra pounds and wondering whether you should focus on weight lifting or cardio? This is a common question that many people have when trying to lose weight. The answer to this question is not as simple as one would think. In this article, we will explore the topic of whether weight lifting or cardio burns more calories.If you are someone who is trying to lose weight, you probably already know that you need to burn more calories than you consume. This can be a challenging task, especially if you are not sure what type of exercise to do. Many people believe that cardio is the best way to burn calories, while others swear by weight lifting. So, which one is better?The answer is both. Both weight lifting and cardio burn calories. However, the number of calories you will burn will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of exercise, the intensity, and the duration.In summary, the question of whether weight lifting or cardio burns more calories is not a simple one to answer. Both forms of exercise burn calories, and the number of calories you burn will depend on various factors. Personal Experience with Weight LiftingI have been weight lifting for the past year, and I have seen a significant change in my body composition. While I did not start weight lifting to lose weight, I did notice that I was burning more calories than I was before. Weight lifting has helped me build muscle and increase my metabolism, which has led to me burning more calories throughout the day.When it comes to weight lifting and burning calories, it is important to note that the number of calories you burn will depend on the intensity and duration of your workout. For example, if you are lifting heavy weights and taking longer rest periods, you will not burn as many calories as you would if you were doing high-intensity interval training (HIIT).Personal Experience with CardioI have also done my fair share of cardio in the past, and I have found it to be an effective way to burn calories. When I was doing cardio regularly, I noticed that I was losing weight, and my endurance was improving. However, I did not see the same changes in my body composition as I did when weight lifting.It is important to note that the number of calories you burn during cardio will depend on the type of exercise you are doing, as well as the intensity and duration of your workout.

This is a common question that many people have when trying to lose weight. The answer to this question is not as simple as one would think. In this article, we will explore the topic of whether weight lifting or cardio burns more calories.</p><p>If you are someone who is trying to lose weight, you probably already know that you need to burn more calories than you consume. This can be a challenging task, especially if you are not sure what type of exercise to do. Many people believe that cardio is the best way to burn calories, while others swear by weight lifting. So, which one is better?</p><p>The answer is both. Both weight lifting and cardio burn calories. However, the number of calories you will burn will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of exercise, the intensity, and the duration.</p><p>In summary, the question of whether weight lifting or cardio burns more calories is not a simple one to answer. Both forms of exercise burn calories, and the number of calories you burn will depend on various factors. </p><p><h2>Personal Experience with Weight Lifting</h2></p><p>I have been weight lifting for the past year, and I have seen a significant change in my body composition. While I did not start weight lifting to lose weight, I did notice that I was burning more calories than I was before. Weight lifting has helped me build muscle and increase my metabolism, which has led to me burning more calories throughout the day.</p><p>When it comes to weight lifting and burning calories, it is important to note that the number of calories you burn will depend on the intensity and duration of your workout. For example, if you are lifting heavy weights and taking longer rest periods, you will not burn as many calories as you would if you were doing high-intensity interval training (HIIT).</p><p><h2>Personal Experience with Cardio</h2></p><p>I have also done my fair share of cardio in the past, and I have found it to be an effective way to burn calories. When I was doing cardio regularly, I noticed that I was losing weight, and my endurance was improving. However, I did not see the same changes in my body composition as I did when weight lifting.</p><p>It is important to note that the number of calories you burn during cardio will depend on the type of exercise you are doing, as well as the intensity and duration of your workout. For example, running will burn more calories than walking, and HIIT will burn more calories than steady-state cardio.</p><p><h3>Factors that Affect Calorie Burn</h3></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the number of calories you burn during weight lifting or cardio will depend on various factors. Some of these factors include:</p><ul><li>The type of exercise</li><li>The intensity of the exercise</li><li>The duration of the exercise</li><li>Your body composition</li><li>Your age</li><li>Your gender</li></ul><p>It is important to keep these factors in mind when deciding which type of exercise to do. For example, if you are someone who is looking to build muscle and increase your metabolism, weight lifting may be a better option for you. However, if you are someone who is looking to improve your endurance and burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time, cardio may be a better option.</p><p><h4>Tips for Burning More Calories</h4></p><p>If you are looking to burn more calories during your workouts, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your workouts</li><li>Try to lift heavier weights and take shorter rest periods</li><li>Incorporate compound exercises into your weight lifting routine</li><li>Incorporate cardio into your workouts</li><li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet</li></ul><p><h2>Personal Experience with Weight Lifting and Cardio</h2></p><p>After trying both weight lifting and cardio, I have found that incorporating both into my workout routine has been the most effective way for me to burn calories and achieve my fitness goals. I typically weight lift three days a week and do cardio two days a week. This has allowed me to build muscle, increase my metabolism, and burn a lot of calories.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Does weight lifting burn more calories than cardio?</strong></p><p>A: The number of calories you burn during weight lifting or cardio will depend on various factors, including the type of exercise, the intensity, and the duration. Both forms of exercise burn calories, and the number of calories you burn will depend on these factors.</p><p><strong>Q: Is cardio or weight lifting better for weight loss?</strong></p><p>A: Both cardio and weight lifting can be effective for weight loss. However, weight lifting can help you build muscle, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I do weight lifting and cardio?</strong></p><p>A: The frequency of your weight lifting and cardio workouts will depend on your fitness goals and your schedule. It is recommended to do at least two days of weight lifting and two days of cardio per week.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do weight lifting and cardio on the same day?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do weight lifting and cardio on the same day. However, it is important to plan your workouts accordingly and make sure you are not overtraining.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Does Weight Lifting or Cardio Burn More Calories</h2></p><p>When it comes to weight lifting or cardio, both forms of exercise can be effective for burning calories. The number of calories you burn will depend on various factors, including the type of exercise, the intensity, and the duration. It is important to choose the type of exercise that works best for you and your fitness goals. By incorporating both weight lifting and cardio into your workout routine, you can burn more calories, build muscle, and achieve your fitness goals.</p></article>
