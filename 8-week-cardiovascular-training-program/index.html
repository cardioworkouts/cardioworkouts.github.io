This will make it easier to stick to the program and stay motivated.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I still strength train while following the 8 week cardiovascular training program?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can still strength train while following the 8 week cardiovascular training program. However, it's important to allow for rest and recovery between workouts to prevent injury and burnout.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I don't see significant improvements after 8 weeks?</strong></p><p>A: It's important to remember that everyone's fitness journey is different.
