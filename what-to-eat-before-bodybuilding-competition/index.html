Eating the right foods before a competition can also help reduce muscle fatigue and soreness, improve your focus and concentration, and enhance your overall performance.</p><h2>What to Eat Before a Bodybuilding Competition</h2><p>When it comes to what to eat before bodybuilding competition, it's essential to focus on foods that are high in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Here are some examples of foods to include in your pre-competition meal:</p><h3>Protein:</h3><p>Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, making it a crucial nutrient for bodybuilders. Some good sources of protein to include in your pre-competition meal include:</p><ul><li>Chicken breast</li><li>Salmon</li><li>Egg whites</li><li>Lean beef</li><li>Whey protein powder</li></ul><h3>Healthy Fats:</h3><p>Healthy fats are essential for providing your body with sustained energy and helping to reduce inflammation.

I also like to have a small green salad with some olive oil and vinegar dressing on the side.</p><h2>Hydration Before a Bodybuilding Competition</h2><p>Staying hydrated is just as important as eating the right foods before a bodybuilding competition. Make sure to drink plenty of water in the days leading up to your competition to ensure your body is hydrated.
