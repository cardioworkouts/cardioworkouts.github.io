It depends on your fitness goals and priorities. If you're aiming to lose weight, doing cardio first might be more beneficial. Cardio exercises help you burn more calories and improve your endurance, which can enhance your performance during weight lifting. However, if your goal is to build muscle, lifting weights first might be more effective. Doing so will help you preserve your energy and allow you to lift heavier weights, which can lead to better muscle growth. </p><p>It's important to note that there's no right or wrong answer. Both cardio and weight training are crucial for overall fitness, and it's recommended to incorporate both into your workout routine. The order in which you do them depends on your fitness goals and preferences.</p><h3>The benefits of Cardio</h3><p>Cardio exercises help improve your cardiovascular health, increase your endurance, and burn calories. They're a great way to warm up your body before weight training, and they can help you recover faster after a workout. Cardio exercises come in various forms, such as running, cycling, swimming, and dancing. The key is to find a form of cardio that you enjoy and can stick to in the long run.</p><h4>The benefits of Weight Training</h4><p>Weight training is an excellent way to build muscle, increase strength, and improve your overall fitness. It can help you burn calories even after your workout, which is known as the after-burn effect. Weight training can also improve your bone density and reduce the risk of injury. It's essential to have proper form and technique when lifting weights to avoid any injuries.</p><h2>How to incorporate Cardio and Weight Training into your Workout?</h2><p>If you're new to fitness, it's recommended to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workout. It's also important to have a balanced workout routine that includes both cardio and weight training. A typical workout routine could look like this:</p><ul><li>Warm-up: 5-10 minutes of light cardio, such as jogging or jumping jacks.</li><li>Cardio: 20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio, such as running or cycling.</li><li>Weights: 20-30 minutes of weight training, targeting different muscle groups on different days.</li><li>Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching.</li></ul><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h4>Q: Should I do cardio or weights first?</h4><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals. If you're aiming to lose weight, doing cardio first might be more beneficial. However, if your goal is to build muscle, lifting weights first might be more effective. </p><h4>Q: How long should I do cardio before weight training?</h4><p>A: It's recommended to do cardio for 20-30 minutes before weight training. This will help warm up your body and improve your performance during weight lifting.</p><h4>Q: Can I do cardio and weight training on the same day?</h4><p>A: Yes, you can do both cardio and weight training on the same day. However, it's important to have a balanced workout routine and not over-exhaust your body.</p><h4>Q: How many times a week should I do cardio and weight training?</h4><p>A: It's recommended to do cardio and weight training at least three times a week to see significant results. However, the frequency and duration of your workout depend on your fitness goals and priorities.</p><h2>Conclusion of supposed to do cardio or weights first</h2><p>Overall, whether you start with cardio or weights depends on your fitness goals and priorities. Both cardio and weight training are crucial for overall fitness, and it's recommended to incorporate both into your workout routine.
