This way, you can focus on strength training when your energy levels are highest, and then finish with cardio to burn calories and improve endurance.</p><p>Another approach is to do intervals of weightlifting and cardio throughout your workout. For example, you could alternate between five minutes of weightlifting and five minutes of cardio for a full hour-long workout. This method can be beneficial for improving overall fitness and burning calories.</p><p><h3>Tips for Optimizing Your Routine</h3></p><p>To get the most out of your cardio and weightlifting same day Reddit routine, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><p>1.
