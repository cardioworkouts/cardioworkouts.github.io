And why? " width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><figcaption><strong><u>Do you do cardio before or after weights session? And why? </u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you trying to lose weight or gain muscle? Have you ever wondered what the best order of exercises is for achieving your fitness goals? Many people believe that doing cardio before weights is the most effective way to burn fat, but the truth is that doing cardio after weights is actually better. In this article, we will explore why this is the case and how it can benefit your workouts.</p><h2>Pain Points of Doing Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Before we dive into the benefits of doing cardio after weights, let's first address the pain points of doing cardio before weights. One of the main issues with this approach is that it can deplete your energy levels, making it more difficult to complete your weightlifting routine. When you do cardio first, you are using up your glycogen (stored carbohydrates) and leaving less fuel for your muscles to use during weightlifting. This can lead to a decrease in strength and endurance, and ultimately affect the quality of your workout.</p><h2>Answering the Target: Why is it Better to Do Cardio After Weights?</h2><p>So, why is it better to do cardio after weights? The main reason is that weightlifting is more effective at burning fat than cardio alone. When you lift weights, your body is using up glycogen and fat for energy. This means that by the time you get to your cardio routine, your body has already depleted most of its glycogen stores and is therefore more likely to burn fat for energy. Additionally, weightlifting creates an "afterburn" effect, where your body continues to burn calories for hours after your workout is complete.</p><p>Another benefit of doing cardio after weights is that it can help to increase your overall fitness level. When you do cardio first, you may feel too fatigued to perform your weightlifting exercises with proper form and technique. This can lead to injuries and setbacks in your progress. By doing weightlifting first, you can ensure that you are performing your exercises correctly and with proper intensity, which can lead to better results.</p><h2>Summary of Main Points</h2><p>In summary, doing cardio after weights is better than doing cardio before weights for several reasons. Weightlifting is more effective at burning fat, creates an "afterburn" effect, and can help to increase your overall fitness level. Doing cardio first can deplete your energy levels, leading to a decrease in strength and endurance, and affect the quality of your workout.</p><h2>Improved Fat Burning</h2><p>Personally, I have found that doing cardio after weights has greatly improved my fat burning results. When I used to do cardio first, I would often feel fatigued and struggle to complete my weightlifting routine with proper form. However, since switching to weights first, I have noticed an increase in my strength and endurance, which has allowed me to push myself harder during cardio. As a result, I have seen a significant improvement in my overall body composition.</p><h2>Increased Fitness Level</h2><p>Another personal benefit of doing cardio after weights is that it has helped me to increase my overall fitness level. By doing weightlifting first, I am able to perform my exercises with proper form and technique, which has led to better results. I have also found that I am able to complete my cardio routine with more intensity and for a longer duration, which has helped me to improve my cardiovascular endurance.</p><h3>How it Works</h3><p>When you do cardio after weights, your body has already depleted most of its glycogen stores and is therefore more likely to burn fat for energy. Additionally, weightlifting creates an "afterburn" effect, where your body continues to burn calories for hours after your workout is complete. This means that even after you have finished your weightlifting routine, your body is still burning calories and fat.</p><h4>How to Incorporate Cardio After Weights</h4><p>If you are new to exercising or have never tried doing cardio after weights before, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase your intensity over time. Begin by doing a 5-10 minute cardio warm-up before your weightlifting routine, such as walking or jogging on a treadmill. After your weightlifting is complete, gradually increase your cardio intensity and duration over time. Aim to do at least 20-30 minutes of cardio after your weightlifting routine, and gradually increase this to 45-60 minutes as your fitness level improves.</p><h2>Improved Results</h2><p>Overall, doing cardio after weights can help you to achieve better results in terms of fat burning and overall fitness level. By incorporating this approach into your workout routine, you can ensure that you are maximizing your time and effort in the gym. So, why not give it a try and see how it works for you?</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it necessary to do cardio after weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> No, it is not necessary to do cardio after weights. However, it has been shown to be more effective for fat burning and overall fitness level.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How long should I wait to do cardio after weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is recommended to wait at least 20-30 minutes after weightlifting before starting your cardio routine.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I still do cardio before weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can still do cardio before weights if that is your preference. However, keep in mind that it may affect your energy levels and overall workout quality.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What types of cardio are best to do after weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and steady-state cardio are both effective options to do after weights.</p><h2>Conclusion of Why is it Better to Do Cardio After Weights</h2><p>In conclusion, doing cardio after weights is a more effective approach to achieving your fitness goals than doing cardio before weights. By incorporating this approach into your workout routine, you can improve your fat burning results, increase your overall fitness level, and maximize your time and effort in the gym.</p></article>
