Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and engage your core muscles while pedaling.</li><li>Challenge yourself: As you become more comfortable with cycling, don't be afraid to increase the resistance level and challenge yourself. This will help you continue to improve your fitness over time.</li><li>Stay hydrated: It's important to stay hydrated during your workout, so be sure to have a water bottle nearby and take breaks as needed to drink water.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: How long should I cycle on a stationary bike?</h3><p>A: It's recommended to aim for at least 30 minutes of cycling per day, but you can adjust this based on your fitness level and goals.</p><h3>Q: Is cycling on a stationary bike bad for your knees?</h3><p>A: No, cycling on a stationary bike is a low-impact exercise that is easy on your joints.
