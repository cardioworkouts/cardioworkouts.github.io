However, I noticed that I wasn't able to lift as heavy weights as I wanted to, and my muscles felt fatigued after just a few reps.</p><p>After doing some research, I discovered that doing cardio after strength training was the best option for me. I started with a short 10-minute cardio workout, which gradually increased to 20-30 minutes over time. I found that doing cardio after strength training helped me burn more calories, and I felt less fatigued during my strength training sessions.</p><p><h2>How Long Should I Do Cardio After Strength Training for Weight Loss?</h2></p><p>If your primary goal is to lose weight, you should aim for a longer cardio workout after strength training, ideally between 30-60 minutes.
