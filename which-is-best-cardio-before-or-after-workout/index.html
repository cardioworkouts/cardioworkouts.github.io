This leads to more fat loss and a better overall calorie burn.On the other hand, if your primary goal is to improve your cardiovascular fitness, then it is recommended to perform cardio before your workout.

This is a valid concern, as the timing of your cardio can have a significant impact on your fitness goals. In general, the answer to this question depends on your individual fitness goals and preferences.</p><p>If your primary goal is weight loss, then it is recommended to perform cardio after your workout. This is because when you do weight training first, you deplete your glycogen stores, and your body starts to burn fat for fuel during your cardio session. This leads to more fat loss and a better overall calorie burn.</p><p>On the other hand, if your primary goal is to improve your cardiovascular fitness, then it is recommended to perform cardio before your workout. This is because when you do cardio first, you warm up your body and get your heart rate up, which prepares you for the more intense weight training session that follows.</p><p><h2>My Personal Experience</h2></p><p>Personally, I prefer to do cardio after my weight training session. I find that I have more energy for my weight training when I am not already fatigued from cardio. Additionally, I enjoy the feeling of ending my workout with a good cardio session, which leaves me feeling energized and accomplished.</p><p><h2>Benefits of Cardio Before Workout</h2></p><p>If you choose to do cardio before your workout, there are several benefits to doing so.

Lastly, make sure to properly cool down and stretch after your cardio session to prevent injury and promote recovery.</p><p><h4>Benefits of Cardio After Workout</h4></p><p>If you choose to do cardio after your workout, there are also several benefits to doing so.
