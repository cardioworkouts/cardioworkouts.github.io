I have found that this type of training has not only helped me burn more calories but has also made my workouts more enjoyable and challenging. </p><p><h2>How to Get Started with Aerobic Interval Training</h2></p><p>If you're new to aerobic interval training, it's essential to start slowly and build up gradually. Begin by incorporating short intervals of high-intensity exercise into your workouts, followed by longer periods of lower-intensity exercise or rest.
