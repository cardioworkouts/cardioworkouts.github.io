A proper warm-up should include 5-10 minutes of cardiovascular exercise and dynamic stretching.</p><h3>Q: How can I stay motivated to exercise as a beginner?</h3><p>A: Setting realistic goals, finding a workout buddy, and tracking your progress can help to keep you motivated. It's also important to find activities that you enjoy and to switch up your routine to prevent boredom.</p><h3>Q: Can I do too much exercise as a beginner?</h3><p>A: Yes, it's important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and frequency of your workouts.
