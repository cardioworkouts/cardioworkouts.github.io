Lower your body until your chest almost touches the ground.</p><p>4. Push back up to the starting position, keeping your body straight throughout the movement.</p><p>Perform 3 sets of 10-12 reps.</p><p><h2>Wide Arm Push-Ups</h2></p><p>Wide Arm Push-Ups target the chest muscles and are an excellent variation to regular push-ups. They are performed the same way as regular push-ups, except your hands are placed wider than shoulder-width apart. To perform a Wide Arm Push-Up:</p><p>1.

Push back up to the starting position, keeping your body straight throughout the movement.</p><p>Perform 3 sets of 10-12 reps.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p>Q: Can I do these exercises every day?</p><p>A: It is recommended to give your muscles a break in between workouts, so it is best to do these exercises every other day.</p><p>Q: How long will it take to see results?</p><p>A: Results vary from person to person, but with consistent effort and a healthy diet, you can expect to see results in 4-8 weeks.</p><p>Q: Can I modify these exercises if they are too challenging?</p><p>A: Yes, you can modify these exercises by performing them on your knees or starting with fewer reps and sets.</p><p>Q: How can I make these exercises more challenging?</p><p>A: You can make these exercises more challenging by adding a pause at the bottom of the movement, increasing the number of reps and sets, or adding a weight vest.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Beginner Chest Workout at Home Without Equipment</h2></p><p>In conclusion, a beginner chest workout at home without equipment is possible and effective. Push-Ups, Wide Arm Push-Ups, Diamond Push-Ups, and Decline Push-Ups are excellent exercises that can be done anywhere and require no equipment.
