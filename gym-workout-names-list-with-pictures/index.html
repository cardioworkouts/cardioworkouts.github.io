We'll be sharing a variety of exercises with pictures and instructions, so you can ensure you're doing them correctly and avoiding injury. Let's dive into our first category of exercises!</p><h2>Upper Body Exercises</h2><p>One of our favorite categories of exercises is upper body workouts. These exercises target your arms, chest, shoulders, and back, helping you build strength and tone your muscles. A personal favorite of ours is the push-up. This exercise can be done anywhere and is great for targeting your chest, triceps, and shoulders. To do a push-up, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down to the ground, keeping your elbows close to your body. Push back up to the starting position and repeat.</p><p>Another great upper body exercise is the dumbbell bicep curl. This exercise targets your biceps and can be done with a pair of dumbbells. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand. Keeping your elbows close to your body, curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders. Lower the dumbbells back down and repeat.</p><h2>Lower Body Exercises</h2><p>Your lower body is just as important as your upper body, and there are plenty of exercises you can do to target your legs, glutes, and hips. One of our favorite lower body exercises is the squat. This exercise targets your quads, hamstrings, and glutes. To do a squat, start with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Lower your body down as if you're sitting in a chair, keeping your weight in your heels. Push back up to the starting position and repeat.</p><p>Another great lower body exercise is the lunge. This exercise targets your quads, hamstrings, and glutes, as well as your core for stability. To do a lunge, start with your feet hip-width apart. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body down until your right thigh is parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position and repeat on the other side.</p><h3>Core Exercises</h3><p>Your core is essential for stability and balance, and there are plenty of exercises you can do to target your abs and obliques. One of our favorite core exercises is the plank. This exercise targets your abs, back, and shoulders. To do a plank, start in a push-up position with your arms straight and your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your forearms to the ground, keeping your body in a straight line from your head to your heels. Hold for as long as you can, keeping your abs tight and your back straight.</p><h4>How to Incorporate These Exercises Into Your Routine</h4><p>Now that you have a list of exercises to choose from, the question is how to incorporate them into your gym routine. We recommend choosing a few exercises from each category and doing them in sets of 10-12 reps, with 2-3 sets per exercise. This will give you a full-body workout and help you target different muscle groups. It's also important to take rest days and listen to your body.
