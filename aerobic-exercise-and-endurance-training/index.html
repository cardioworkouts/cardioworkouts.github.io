As your fitness level improves, you can gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts. Remember to listen to your body and take rest days as needed, especially if you experience any pain or discomfort.</p><h3>The Importance of Proper Form and Technique</h3><p>When engaging in aerobic exercise and endurance training, it's essential to use proper form and technique.
