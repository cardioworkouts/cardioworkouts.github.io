These activities are easy on the joints and can be done at a slower pace to build endurance and stamina gradually.</p><p><h3>How often should I do cardio?</h3></p><p>It's recommended to do at least 150 minutes of moderate cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio each week. This can be broken down into smaller sessions throughout the day or week, depending on your schedule and fitness level.</p><p><h3>Can I lose weight with just cardio?</h3></p><p>While cardio can aid in weight loss, it's essential to incorporate strength training and a healthy diet for optimal results. Strength training helps build muscle, which can boost your metabolism and burn more calories throughout the day.</p><p><h3>How can I stay motivated to do cardio?</h3></p><p>Find activities that you enjoy and mix up your routine to prevent boredom. Set specific goals and track your progress to stay motivated. Lastly, find a workout buddy or accountability partner to help you stay committed to your fitness journey.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Can Only Do 5 Minutes of Cardio</h2></p><p>While it may seem challenging to stick to a cardio routine when you can only do 5 minutes at a time, incorporating short bouts of exercise into your daily routine can provide significant health benefits. By choosing high-intensity exercises, using intervals, and gradually increasing your time, you can make the most of your 5 minutes of cardio and see real progress in your fitness journey.</p></article>
