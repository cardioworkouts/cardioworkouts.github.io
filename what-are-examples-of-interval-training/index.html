Some may find it difficult to stay motivated and see results, while others may not have enough time to dedicate to a lengthy workout. Interval training can be an effective solution to these pain points as it offers a quick and efficient workout that can be tailored to your fitness level and goals.</p><h2>What Are Examples of Interval Training?</h2><p>There are many different types of interval training, but some of the most popular examples include:</p><h3>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h3><p>HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by periods of rest or lower intensity.

This type of interval training can be done with various exercises, including squats, push-ups, and burpees.</p><h3>Circuit Training</h3><p>Circuit training involves a series of exercises performed back-to-back with little to no rest in between. This type of interval training can be done with various exercises, including bodyweight exercises, weightlifting, and cardio. A common example of a circuit training workout is performing 10 reps of squats, followed by 10 reps of push-ups, and 10 reps of lunges, repeating for several rounds.</p><h3>Fartlek Training</h3><p>Fartlek training involves alternating periods of high and low intensity during a workout.
