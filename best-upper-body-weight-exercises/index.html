To perform a bench press, lie down on a bench with your feet planted firmly on the ground. Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower the barbell to your chest and then press it back up to the starting position. Repeat for several repetitions.</p><p>When I first started doing bench press, I struggled with the weight and felt intimidated by the other gym-goers. However, with practice and consistency, I was able to increase my strength and confidence. Now, bench press is one of my favorite upper body weight exercises.</p><h2>Push-Ups</h2><p>Push-ups are a great upper body weight exercise that requires no equipment and can be done anywhere.

Now, pull-ups are one of the most rewarding upper body weight exercises that I do.</p><h4>Rows</h4><p>Rows are an effective upper body weight exercise that targets your upper back and shoulders. To perform a row, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bend at the waist and lower the dumbbells towards the ground. Then, pull the dumbbells up towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position and repeat for several repetitions.</p><p>When I first started doing rows, I struggled with my form and felt like I wasn't getting the full benefit of the exercise. However, with guidance from a personal trainer, I was able to improve my form and increase my strength. Now, rows are one of my go-to upper body weight exercises.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: How often should I do upper body weight exercises?</strong></p><p>A: It's recommended that you do upper body weight exercises at least twice a week, with a rest day in between.
