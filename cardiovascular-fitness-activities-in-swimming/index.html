It involves alternating periods of high-intensity exercise with periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. When I started doing interval training in the pool, I would swim as fast as I could for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of rest. I would repeat this cycle for 20-30 minutes. Interval training can help improve your endurance, increase your lung capacity, and burn calories.</p><p><h3>Water Aerobics</h3></p><p>Water aerobics is a low-impact workout that is suitable for people of all fitness levels.
