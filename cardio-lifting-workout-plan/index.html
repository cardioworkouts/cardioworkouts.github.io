Make sure you're using the correct technique for each exercise.</p><p><strong>3. Gradually Increase Intensity:</strong> As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the intensity of your cardio and weightlifting workouts. Start with lighter weights and shorter cardio sessions, and gradually work your way up to heavier weights and longer workouts.</p><h3>Sample Cardio Lifting Workout Plan</h3><p>If you're not sure where to start with your cardio lifting workout plan, here's a sample workout to try:</p><ul><li>Warm-up: 5 minutes of light cardio (jogging or jumping jacks)</li><li>Weightlifting: 3 sets of 10 reps of bench press, bicep curls, and squats</li><li>Cardio: 1 minute of high-intensity interval training (sprinting or jumping jacks)</li><li>Weightlifting: 3 sets of 10 reps of shoulder press, tricep extensions, and lunges</li><li>Cardio: 1 minute of high-intensity interval training (sprinting or jumping jacks)</li><li>Cool-down: 5 minutes of light cardio and stretching</li></ul><h4>Tips for Success with Your Cardio Lifting Workout Plan</h4><p>Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your cardio lifting workout plan:</p><p><strong>1.
