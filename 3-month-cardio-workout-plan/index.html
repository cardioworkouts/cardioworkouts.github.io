You can also add in some strength training exercises to build muscle and burn more calories.</p><p><strong>Month 3:</strong> Aim for 60 minutes of cardio, five times a week. Mix up your routine to keep things interesting, such as trying a new class at the gym or taking your workout outside.</p><p>Remember to listen to your body and take rest days when needed. If you feel like you need to adjust the plan, feel free to do so. The most important thing is to stay consistent and keep moving forward.</p><p><h2>Tips for Staying Motivated</h2></p><p>It's easy to get discouraged when progress is slow or when life gets in the way.
