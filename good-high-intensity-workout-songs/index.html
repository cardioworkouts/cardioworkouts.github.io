Do you find yourself losing motivation halfway through your high intensity workout? Look no further, because we've compiled a list of the best high intensity workout songs that will keep you energized and motivated from start to finish.</p><h2>Pain Points of Finding Good High Intensity Workout Songs</h2><p>We've all been there - you're in the middle of a grueling workout, and your playlist is just not cutting it. The music is too slow, too mellow, and not motivating you to push through the burn. A lack of good high intensity workout songs can lead to a decrease in motivation and ultimately, a less effective workout.</p><h2>The Target of Good High Intensity Workout Songs</h2><p>The goal of good high intensity workout songs is to provide an extra boost of energy and motivation to push through even the toughest workouts. These songs typically have a fast-paced beat, catchy lyrics, and an overall high-energy vibe.</p><p>Some examples of good high intensity workout songs include "Lose Control" by Missy Elliott, "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor, and "Can't Hold Us" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.</p><h2>Main Points about Good High Intensity Workout Songs</h2><p>Good high intensity workout songs are essential for maintaining motivation and pushing through tough workouts. These songs typically have a fast-paced beat, catchy lyrics, and an overall high-energy vibe. Examples include "Lose Control" by Missy Elliott and "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor.</p><h2>"Lose Control" by Missy Elliott</h2><p>One of my personal favorite high intensity workout songs is "Lose Control" by Missy Elliott. The beat is fast-paced and energetic, with catchy lyrics that make you want to move. I always find myself pushing harder and running faster when this song comes on.</p><p>In addition to being a great workout song, "Lose Control" also has a message of empowerment and self-confidence. This makes it the perfect song to listen to when you need to push through a tough workout and remind yourself of your own strength and resilience.</p><h2>"Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor</h2><p>"Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor is another classic high intensity workout song that never fails to get me pumped up. The opening guitar riff is instantly recognizable, and the lyrics are all about pushing yourself to be the best you can be.</p><p>This song is especially great for high intensity workouts that require mental toughness and focus, like running sprints or doing high-intensity interval training. The lyrics and overall vibe of the song remind you that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to, as long as you stay focused and determined.</p><h3>The Importance of Beats Per Minute (BPM)</h3><p>When it comes to good high intensity workout songs, one of the most important factors to consider is the beats per minute (BPM) of the song. BPM refers to how many beats there are in one minute of music, and can have a significant impact on your workout performance.</p><p>Generally speaking, good high intensity workout songs should have a BPM of between 120 and 140. This is because this range is optimal for activities like running, cycling, and other high-intensity cardio exercises. Songs with a BPM outside of this range may be too slow or too fast for optimal workout performance.</p><h4>How to Find Good High Intensity Workout Songs</h4><p>The easiest way to find good high intensity workout songs is to search for pre-made workout playlists on music streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music. These playlists are curated by experts and are specifically designed to provide the best possible workout experience.</p><p>Another option is to create your own workout playlist using songs with a BPM between 120 and 140. You can use free online tools like the BPM Calculator to determine the BPM of your favorite songs, and then create a playlist that fits your personal workout style and preferences.</p><h2>"Can't Hold Us" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis</h2><p>"Can't Hold Us" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis is another great high intensity workout song that combines fast-paced beats with motivational lyrics. The chorus is especially catchy, with lyrics like "This is the moment, tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over, so we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us."</p><p>This song is perfect for high intensity workouts that require a lot of energy and endurance, like running or cycling. The fast-paced beat and motivational lyrics will keep you pushing through even the toughest parts of your workout.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Can any song be a good high intensity workout song?</strong></p><p>A: Not necessarily. Good high intensity workout songs should have a fast-paced beat, catchy lyrics, and an overall high-energy vibe. Songs with a BPM of between 120 and 140 are generally best for high-intensity cardio exercises.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I find good high intensity workout songs?</strong></p><p>A: You can search for pre-made workout playlists on music streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music, or create your own playlist using songs with a BPM of between 120 and 140. You can use free online tools like the BPM Calculator to determine the BPM of your favorite songs.</p><p><strong>Q: Why are good high intensity workout songs important?</strong></p><p>A: Good high intensity workout songs are important because they provide an extra boost of energy and motivation to push through even the toughest workouts. They can help you maintain focus, increase endurance, and ultimately get more out of your workout.</p><p><strong>Q: Can listening to good high intensity workout songs improve my workout performance?</strong></p><p>A: Yes! Listening to good high intensity workout songs can improve your workout performance by providing an extra boost of energy and motivation. They can help you maintain focus, increase endurance, and push through even the toughest parts of your workout.</p><h2>Conclusion of Good High Intensity Workout Songs</h2><p>Good high intensity workout songs are essential for maintaining motivation and pushing through tough workouts. These songs typically have a fast-paced beat, catchy lyrics, and an overall high-energy vibe. Examples include "Lose Control" by Missy Elliott, "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor, and "Can't Hold Us" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. To find the best high intensity workout songs, look for pre-made workout playlists or create your own playlist using songs with a BPM of between 120 and 140. With the right music, you can take your workout to the next level and achieve your fitness goals.</p></article>
