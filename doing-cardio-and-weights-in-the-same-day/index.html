This helps prepare your muscles for the workout and reduces the risk of injury. Second, choose the right cardio and weight exercises that complement each other. For example, you could do a strength training exercise followed by a cardio exercise. Third, focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury and maximize results.

Cardio exercises help improve heart health, while weight training helps lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease. Fourth, it builds muscle and improves strength.
