I started jumping rope by doing short intervals and gradually increasing the duration as my stamina improved.</p><p><h2>HIIT Workouts</h2></p><p>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a form of cardio exercise that involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest. HIIT workouts can help you burn calories and lose weight effectively. They are also a time-efficient way to exercise as they can be done in as little as 20 minutes.
