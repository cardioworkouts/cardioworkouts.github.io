Engage your core, squeeze your glutes, and hold your body in a straight line from head to heels.</p><p>3. Hold this position for as long as you can, aiming for at least 30 seconds to start.</p><p>4.

Engage your core and lift your head, neck, and shoulders off the ground, exhaling as you do so.</p><p>4. Hold for a second, then lower back down to the starting position.</p><p>5. Repeat for 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps.</p><p>Personal Experience:</p><p>I've been doing crunches for years, and they've always been a staple in my core workout routine. They've helped me maintain a flat stomach, and I've noticed that my upper abs are more defined.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Exercise</h3><p>In addition to core exercises, cardiovascular exercise can also help reduce upper belly fat. Cardiovascular exercise, such as running or biking, can help burn calories and reduce overall body fat, including belly fat.</p><p>Personal Experience:</p><p>I like to incorporate running into my workout routine to help burn calories and reduce body fat.

Here's an example of how you can do that:</p><p>1. Warm-up for 5-10 minutes with some light cardio, such as jogging or jumping jacks.</p><p>2. Perform 2-3 sets of planks, holding each plank for as long as you can.</p><p>3. Perform 2-3 sets of crunches, aiming for 10-15 reps per set.</p><p>4. Finish with 20-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, such as running or biking.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Can I only do these exercises to reduce upper belly fat?</p><p>A: No, it's important to combine these exercises with a healthy diet and overall exercise routine for the best results.</p><p>Q: How often should I do these exercises?</p><p>A: Aim to do these exercises 2-3 times a week, in addition to your overall exercise routine.</p><p>Q: Can I spot reduce fat?</p><p>A: No, it's not possible to spot reduce fat. You need to combine these exercises with a healthy diet and overall exercise routine for the best results.</p><p>Q: How long does it take to see results?</p><p>A: It varies from person to person, but with consistent effort, you should start to see results in a few weeks to a month.</p><h2>Conclusion of which exercise reduce upper belly fat</h2><p>Reducing upper belly fat can be a challenge, but with the right exercises and a healthy lifestyle, it's possible.
