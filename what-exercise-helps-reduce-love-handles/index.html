<title>How To Reduce Love Handles With Exercise - Cardio Workout Routine</title>
<meta name="description" content="Pin on Waist workoutDo you struggle with excess fat around your waistline? Are you tired of feeling self-conscious about your love handles? You’re not alone. Love handles, also known as muffin tops, can be difficult to get rid of. But with the right exercises, you can reduce them and feel more confident in your own skin.If you’re wondering what exercise helps reduce love handles, the answer is simple: exercises that target the obliques. The obliques are the muscles on the sides of your abdomen. When these muscles are toned, they help to cinch in your waistline, reducing the appearance of love handles.To effectively reduce love handles, it’s important to incorporate a variety of exercises that target the obliques. Here are some of the most effective exercises:1. Side PlankOne of the best exercises for targeting the obliques is the side plank. To perform this exercise, start by lying on your side with your elbow directly under your shoulder. Lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from your head to your feet. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch sides. Repeat for 3 sets on each side.Personally, I found this exercise to be challenging at first, but with practice, I was able to hold the side plank for longer periods of time. It’s a great exercise for toning the obliques and reducing love handles.2. Russian TwistThe Russian twist is another effective exercise for targeting the obliques. To perform this exercise, sit on the ground with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground, balancing on your sit bones. Hold a weight or medicine ball in front of your chest and twist your torso to the right, tapping the weight on the ground. Twist back to the left and tap the weight on the ground. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.This exercise is a great way to tone the obliques and reduce the appearance of love handles. When I first started doing Russian twists, I found them to be challenging, but with practice, I was able to increase my reps and see results.3. Bicycle CrunchesBicycle crunches are a great exercise for targeting the entire abdominal area, including the obliques. To perform this exercise, lie on your back with your hands behind your head and your knees bent. Lift your shoulders off the ground and bring your right elbow to your left knee, while straightening your right leg. Twist your torso and bring your left elbow to your right knee, straightening your left leg.

Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.Mountain climbers are a great way to tone the obliques and get a cardio workout at the same time.
