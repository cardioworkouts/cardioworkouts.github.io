Resistance training, also known as strength training, might be just what you need. However, starting a new fitness routine can be daunting, especially if you're unfamiliar with resistance training adalah. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of resistance training, its benefits, and how to get started.</p><p>If you've ever felt intimidated by the weight room or unsure of how to use resistance equipment, you're not alone.
