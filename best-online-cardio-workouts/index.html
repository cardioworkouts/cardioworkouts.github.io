Or perhaps you're new to working out and not sure where to start. Whatever your reason may be, finding the best online cardio workouts can be a game-changer for your fitness journey.</p><p>Cardio workouts are an essential part of any fitness routine, as they help to improve heart health, increase endurance, and burn calories. However, with so many options available online, it can be overwhelming to choose which one is right for you.</p><p>To help you out, we've researched and compiled a list of the best online cardio workouts that cater to different fitness levels and preferences. Whether you're into high-intensity interval training (HIIT), dance cardio, or low-impact workouts, there's something for everyone.</p><p>In this article, we'll explore the best online cardio workouts and related keywords, their targets, and share personal experiences to give you a better understanding of each workout type.</p><h2>1. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h2><p>HIIT is a popular cardio workout that involves short bursts of intense exercises followed by periods of rest or low-intensity activity. The aim of HIIT is to increase heart rate and burn calories in a short amount of time.</p><p>I started doing HIIT workouts a few months ago, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my endurance and overall fitness level. My favorite online HIIT workout is the 30-Minute HIIT Cardio Workout from Fitness Blender. It's challenging but also fun, and the trainers provide modifications for beginners.</p><p>Other popular online HIIT workouts include the 7 Minute Workout app, the Nike Training Club app, and the Popsugar Fitness YouTube channel.</p><h2>2. Dance Cardio</h2><p>If you enjoy dancing and want to incorporate it into your workout routine, dance cardio is a great option. Dance cardio workouts typically involve choreographed routines set to upbeat music.</p><p>I've always loved dancing, so dance cardio is my go-to workout when I want to have fun and break a sweat. My favorite online dance cardio workout is The Fitness Marshall YouTube channel. The instructor, Caleb Marshall, is entertaining and charismatic, and the routines are easy to follow.</p><p>Other popular online dance cardio workouts include the Body by Simone YouTube channel, the Tracy Anderson Method, and the DanceBody app.</p><h3>3. Low-Impact Workouts</h3><p>Low-impact workouts are exercises that don't put too much stress on your joints, making them a great option for people with injuries or joint pain. These workouts typically involve movements that keep one foot on the ground at all times.</p><p>I've recently started incorporating low-impact workouts into my routine, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my joint pain. My favorite online low-impact workout is the Low-Impact Cardio Workout from HASfit. The trainers provide modifications for beginners and make the workout enjoyable.</p><p>Other popular online low-impact workouts include the Jessica Smith TV YouTube channel, the Les Mills BodyBalance program, and the Pure Barre app.</p><h4>4. Running Workouts</h4><p>Running is a classic cardio workout that requires no equipment and can be done anywhere. Running workouts can range from steady-state jogging to interval training.</p><p>Running is not my favorite form of cardio, but I do enjoy mixing it up with interval training. My favorite online running workout is the 30-Minute Treadmill Hill Workout from Runners World. It's challenging but also fun, and the hills make for a great workout.</p><p>Other popular online running workouts include the Couch to 5K program, the Nike Run Club app, and the Zombies, Run! app.</p><h2>Question and Answer:</h2><p><strong>Q: How often should I do cardio workouts?</strong></p><p>A: It's recommended to do cardio workouts for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week. However, it's important to listen to your body and not overdo it. Start with two to three days a week and gradually increase as you feel comfortable.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the best time of day to do cardio workouts?</strong></p><p>A: The best time of day to do cardio workouts is whenever you can fit it into your schedule. Some people prefer morning workouts to kickstart their day, while others prefer evening workouts to wind down after work. Find what works for you and stick to it.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do cardio workouts at home without equipment?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, there are several cardio workouts that you can do at home without equipment, such as jumping jacks, high knees, and mountain climbers. You can also use household items like stairs, chairs, and water bottles to add resistance and intensity to your workouts.</p><p><strong>Q: How long does it take to see results from cardio workouts?</strong></p><p>A: The time it takes to see results from cardio workouts varies from person to person and depends on factors such as fitness level, diet, and consistency. However, with regular cardio workouts, you can expect to see improvements in endurance, weight loss, and overall fitness level within a few weeks to a few months.</p><h2>Conclusion of Best Online Cardio Workouts</h2><p>Finding the best online cardio workouts can be a game-changer for your fitness journey. Whether you prefer high-intensity interval training, dance cardio, low-impact workouts, or running, there's something for everyone. By incorporating these workouts into your routine and staying consistent, you can improve heart health, increase endurance, and burn calories. So, what are you waiting for? Get moving!</p></article>
