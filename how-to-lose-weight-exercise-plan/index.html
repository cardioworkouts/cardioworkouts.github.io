I like to start my workout with a 5-minute warm-up, followed by 30-45 minutes of cardio exercises such as cycling or running. After that, I move on to strength training exercises such as squats, lunges, and push-ups. I end my workout with a 5-minute cool-down and stretching session.</p><p>Cardio exercises are great for burning calories and improving cardiovascular health.
