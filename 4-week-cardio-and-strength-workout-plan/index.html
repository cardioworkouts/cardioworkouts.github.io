This can include exercises such as squats, lunges, and pushups. Beginners should start with lighter weights and focus on proper form to avoid injury.</p><h3>Rest Days</h3><p>Rest days are an essential part of any workout plan, as they allow your body to recover and repair. It is recommended to take at least one or two rest days per week, depending on your fitness level and goals.</p><h3>Nutrition</h3><p>Nutrition is a crucial component of any fitness regimen, as it provides your body with the fuel it needs to perform at its best.
