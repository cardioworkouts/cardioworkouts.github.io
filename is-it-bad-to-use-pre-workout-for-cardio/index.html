Do you find yourself reaching for that pre workout drink to give you an extra boost of energy? While pre workout supplements can be beneficial for weightlifting, is it bad to use pre workout for cardio? Let's delve deeper into this topic.</p><h2>Pain Points</h2><p>Many people use pre workout supplements for that extra energy boost, but some may experience negative side effects such as jitters, nausea, and insomnia.

It ultimately depends on the individual and the type of pre workout supplement they are taking. Some pre workout supplements are specifically formulated for cardio workouts, while others are geared towards weightlifting.</p><p>It's important to read the label and look for ingredients such as caffeine and beta-alanine, which can increase energy and endurance, but may also cause negative side effects. It's also recommended to start with a lower dose and gradually increase to assess your tolerance.</p><h2>Summary of the article's main points</h2><p>Using pre workout supplements for cardio can be effective in providing an extra boost of energy and endurance, but it's important to consider the potential negative side effects.
