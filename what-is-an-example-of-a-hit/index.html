In this tutorial, we'll explore what is an example of a hit, and why it's important to understand this common English phrase.</p><p>When someone refers to a song, movie, or other form of media as a "hit", they are typically implying that it is popular and successful.

This song was a huge hit when it was released in 2007, and it's still a popular song today. I remember hearing it on the radio all the time, and it was played at every school dance and party I went to. "Umbrella" is a great example of a hit song because it was incredibly popular and successful, and it helped to establish Rihanna as one of the biggest pop stars in the world.</p><p><h2>What is an Example of a Hit Movie?</h2></p><p>One of my favorite movies of all time is "The Dark Knight", which was released in 2008.
