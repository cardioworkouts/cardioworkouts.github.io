As you get more comfortable with the movements, you can increase the intensity and duration of your workout.</p><p><h4>Tips for Success with Cardio Drumming</h4></p><p>Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your cardio drumming workout:</p><p>1. Start slowly and build up your endurance over time.</p><p>2. Focus on your form to ensure that you're engaging the correct muscles.</p><p>3.
