To perform a squat, simply stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and bend your knees to lower your body as if you are sitting down in a chair. Keep your weight on your heels and your back straight.

This exercise targets your whole body and increases your heart rate to maximize calorie burn. To perform a jumping jack, simply stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides.

Alternate legs as fast as you can for as many reps as you can.BurpeesBurpees are a challenging but effective exercise for burning fat at home with no equipment. They target multiple muscle groups and increase your heart rate to maximize calorie burn. To perform a burpee, start in a standing position, then crouch down and place your hands on the ground in front of you.
