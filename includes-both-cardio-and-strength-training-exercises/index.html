Ideally, you should aim to do both types of exercises at least 3-4 times a week.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I do cardio before or after strength-training exercises?</strong></p><p>A: It is recommended to do strength-training exercises before cardio. This will help you preserve your energy for lifting weights and prevent fatigue during your strength-training exercises.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do both types of exercises in one workout session?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do both types of exercises in one workout session. However, it is important to prioritize your strength-training exercises and do them first.</p><p><strong>Q: How long should my workout session be?</strong></p><p>A: Your workout session should be at least 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your fitness goals and your schedule.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Incorporating Both Cardio and Strength-Training Exercises in Your Workout Routine</h2></p><p>Including both cardio and strength-training exercises in your workout routine is a great way to achieve overall fitness and wellness.
