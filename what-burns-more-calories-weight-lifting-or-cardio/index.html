<title>What Burns More Calories  Weight Lifting Or Cardio  - Cardio Workout Routine</title>
<meta name="description" content="Cardio exercises to burn 100 calories. Cardio workout, FitnessAre you looking to lose weight or maintain your current weight? Are you wondering what type of exercise burns more calories, weight lifting or cardio? If you&#39;re struggling to decide between the two, you&#39;re not alone. Many people are confused about which type of exercise is better for weight loss. In this article, we will explore the differences between weight lifting and cardio and determine which one burns more calories.If you&#39;re like most people, you want to lose weight and get in shape, but you may not know where to start. The good news is that both weight lifting and cardio can help you achieve your fitness goals, but they work in different ways. Depending on your fitness goals, you may prefer one type of exercise over the other.So, what burns more calories, weight lifting or cardio? The answer is not simple since both types of exercise can burn calories effectively. However, cardio burns more calories per hour than weight lifting. According to Harvard Health Publishing, a 155-pound person can burn approximately 260 calories in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity weight lifting and 370 calories in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio.In summary, both weight lifting and cardio can help you burn calories and lose weight. However, if you want to burn more calories per hour, cardio is the better option. But don&#39;t let that discourage you from weight lifting. Weight lifting has many other benefits, such as building muscle mass and increasing bone density. My Experience with Cardio and Weight LiftingI used to be a cardio addict. I would spend hours on the treadmill, running at a moderate pace, thinking that I was burning the most calories possible. However, I wasn&#39;t seeing the results I wanted. I was losing weight, but I wasn&#39;t toning up, and I was feeling tired all the time. One day, I decided to try weight lifting, and I was hooked. I loved the feeling of lifting weights and the way my body was changing. I was losing fat and gaining muscle mass. I also noticed that my energy levels were higher, and I wasn&#39;t feeling as tired as I used to. However, I didn&#39;t give up cardio entirely. I still enjoy going for runs or doing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. I find that doing a combination of weight lifting and cardio works best for me.Benefits of Weight LiftingWeight lifting has many benefits, such as:-Building muscle mass -Increasing bone density -Boosting metabolism -Improving posture -Reducing the risk of injury -Enhancing overall fitness levelsWhen you lift weights, you&#39;re not only burning calories during the workout, but you&#39;re also building muscle mass.

Cardio workout, Fitness</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p></p><p>Are you looking to lose weight or maintain your current weight? Are you wondering what type of exercise burns more calories, weight lifting or cardio? If you're struggling to decide between the two, you're not alone. Many people are confused about which type of exercise is better for weight loss. In this article, we will explore the differences between weight lifting and cardio and determine which one burns more calories.</p><p>If you're like most people, you want to lose weight and get in shape, but you may not know where to start. The good news is that both weight lifting and cardio can help you achieve your fitness goals, but they work in different ways. Depending on your fitness goals, you may prefer one type of exercise over the other.</p><p>So, what burns more calories, weight lifting or cardio? The answer is not simple since both types of exercise can burn calories effectively. However, cardio burns more calories per hour than weight lifting. According to Harvard Health Publishing, a 155-pound person can burn approximately 260 calories in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity weight lifting and 370 calories in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio.</p><p>In summary, both weight lifting and cardio can help you burn calories and lose weight. However, if you want to burn more calories per hour, cardio is the better option. But don't let that discourage you from weight lifting. Weight lifting has many other benefits, such as building muscle mass and increasing bone density. </p><p><h2>My Experience with Cardio and Weight Lifting</h2></p><p>I used to be a cardio addict. I would spend hours on the treadmill, running at a moderate pace, thinking that I was burning the most calories possible. However, I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. I was losing weight, but I wasn't toning up, and I was feeling tired all the time. </p><p>One day, I decided to try weight lifting, and I was hooked. I loved the feeling of lifting weights and the way my body was changing. I was losing fat and gaining muscle mass. I also noticed that my energy levels were higher, and I wasn't feeling as tired as I used to. </p><p>However, I didn't give up cardio entirely. I still enjoy going for runs or doing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. I find that doing a combination of weight lifting and cardio works best for me.</p><p><h2>Benefits of Weight Lifting</h2></p><p>Weight lifting has many benefits, such as:</p><p>-Building muscle mass<br> -Increasing bone density<br> -Boosting metabolism<br> -Improving posture<br> -Reducing the risk of injury<br> -Enhancing overall fitness levels</p><p>When you lift weights, you're not only burning calories during the workout, but you're also building muscle mass. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means that the more muscle you have, the more calories your body will burn at rest. Weight lifting can also help improve your posture and reduce the risk of injury by strengthening your muscles and bones.</p><p><h3>Benefits of Cardio</h3></p><p>Cardio also has many benefits, such as:</p><p>-Improving cardiovascular health<br> -Burning calories<br> -Boosting mood<br> -Reducing stress<br> -Enhancing overall fitness levels</p><p>Cardiovascular exercise, such as running, biking, or swimming, can help improve your heart health and burn calories. Cardio can also boost your mood and reduce stress levels by releasing endorphins, which are feel-good chemicals in your brain.</p><p><h4>How to Incorporate Both Weight Lifting and Cardio into Your Fitness Routine</h4></p><p>If you're looking to incorporate both weight lifting and cardio into your fitness routine, here are a few tips:</p><p>-Schedule your workouts<br> -Start with weight lifting<br> -Add in cardio<br> -Alternate between the two<br> -Listen to your body</p><p>It's important to schedule your workouts and make exercise a priority. Start with weight lifting and add in cardio gradually. You can alternate between the two or do them on separate days. Listen to your body and don't overdo it.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What Burns More Calories: Weight Lifting or Cardio?</h2></p><p>In conclusion, both weight lifting and cardio can help you burn calories and achieve your fitness goals. However, if you want to burn more calories per hour, cardio is the better option. Weight lifting has many other benefits, such as building muscle mass and increasing bone density. The best approach is to incorporate both weight lifting and cardio into your fitness routine and find what works best for you. Remember to listen to your body and make exercise a priority.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Does weight lifting help you lose weight?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, weight lifting can help you lose weight by burning calories and building muscle mass.</p><p><strong>Q: Is cardio better than weight lifting for weight loss?</strong></p><p>A: Cardio burns more calories per hour than weight lifting, but weight lifting has many other benefits, such as building muscle mass and increasing bone density.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I do weight lifting and cardio?</strong></p><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals and schedule. Aim for at least two to three days of weight lifting and two to three days of cardio per week.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do both weight lifting and cardio on the same day?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do both weight lifting and cardio on the same day, but it's important to listen to your body and not overdo it. Start with weight lifting and add in cardio gradually.</p></article>
