Do you feel like you&#39;re not seeing any results but you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re doing enough? You&#39;re not alone. Many people struggle with determining the ideal time to spend on a treadmill each day.The ideal time to spend on a treadmill each day depends on several factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health. However, the American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week. So, if you&#39;re wondering how long you should stay on the treadmill each day, the answer is at least 30 minutes per day for five days a week if you&#39;re doing moderate-intensity exercise.

Making exercise a habit can improve your overall health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve your mental health. My ExperienceAs a fitness enthusiast, I usually spend at least 45 minutes on the treadmill every day. I find that this is enough time for me to get my heart pumping, break a sweat and feel energized.
