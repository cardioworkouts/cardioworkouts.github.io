Continue alternating legs for 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p><p><h3>Burpees</h3></p><p>Burpees are a full-body exercise that can be challenging but effective. They require no equipment and can be modified to fit any fitness level. To perform burpees:</p><p>1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your sides.</p><p>2.
