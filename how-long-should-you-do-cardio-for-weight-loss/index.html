Are you unsure of how long you should be doing cardio for weight loss? If so, you're not alone. Many people struggle with finding the right amount of cardio to do to see the results they desire. In this blog post, we'll discuss how long you should do cardio for weight loss and provide tips to help you reach your goals.</p><h2>The Pain Points of How Long Should You Do Cardio for Weight Loss</h2><p>One of the biggest pain points related to cardio for weight loss is not knowing how much is enough.

Alternatively, you can do 75 minutes of high-intensity cardio per week, broken down into three 25-minute sessions.</p><p>It's important to note that cardio alone may not be enough for weight loss. A combination of cardio and strength training, along with a healthy diet, is the most effective way to see results.
