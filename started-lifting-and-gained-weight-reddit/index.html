Started 5x5</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you tired of feeling skinny and weak? Have you been scrolling through Reddit, searching for answers on how to gain weight and build muscle? If so, my friend, you are not alone. I, too, was once in your shoes, but through dedication and hard work, I was able to transform my body and gain the weight I always wanted. In this post, I will share my journey on Reddit, and how I started lifting and gained weight.</p><p>When I first started lifting, I was lost and confused. I didn't know where to start or what exercises to do. I felt like I was wasting my time at the gym, and wasn't seeing any results. It wasn't until I stumbled upon the subreddit r/gainit that everything changed. This subreddit provided me with a community of like-minded individuals who were all striving towards the same goal - gaining weight and building muscle.</p><p>So, what is r/gainit? It's a subreddit dedicated to helping individuals gain weight and build muscle through sharing tips, advice, and personal stories. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, this subreddit has something for everyone.</p><p>In summary, my journey on Reddit began with finding the subreddit r/gainit. This community provided me with the necessary tools and resources to start my journey towards gaining weight and building muscle.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Starting Lifting and Gaining Weight on Reddit</h2><p>When I first started lifting, I was hesitant and unsure of myself. I didn't know if I was doing the exercises correctly or if I was even making progress. However, after joining r/gainit, I was able to receive feedback and support from other members of the community. This helped me to stay motivated and continue pushing myself towards my goals.</p><p>One of the biggest takeaways from my experience on r/gainit was the importance of tracking my progress. Whether it was through taking progress pictures or keeping a log of my workouts, tracking my progress helped me to see how far I had come and kept me motivated to continue pushing myself.</p><p>In conclusion, my personal experience on Reddit has been nothing short of amazing. Without the support and guidance from the r/gainit community, I don't think I would have been able to achieve my goals.</p><h2>Tips for Starting Lifting and Gaining Weight on Reddit</h2><p>If you're new to lifting and trying to gain weight, here are some tips to help you get started:</p><h3>1. Set Realistic Goals</h3><p>When starting your journey, it's important to set realistic goals. Don't expect to see results overnight, and don't compare yourself to others. Everyone's journey is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.</p><h3>2. Track Your Progress</h3><p>As mentioned before, tracking your progress is crucial to staying motivated and seeing results. Whether it's through progress pictures or a workout log, tracking your progress will help you see how far you've come.</p><h3>3. Stay Consistent</h3><p>Consistency is key when it comes to lifting and gaining weight. Make sure to stick to a routine and don't give up when things get tough. Remember, progress takes time, and it won't happen overnight.</p><h2>My Final Thoughts on Starting Lifting and Gaining Weight on Reddit</h2><p>In conclusion, if you're looking to gain weight and build muscle, Reddit is a great place to start. The r/gainit community is supportive and informative, and the resources they provide can help you achieve your goals. Remember to set realistic goals, track your progress, and stay consistent. With hard work and dedication, you can transform your body and gain the weight you always wanted.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I start lifting and gaining weight even if I'm a beginner?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! Everyone starts somewhere, and it's important to remember that progress takes time. Start with a beginner's routine and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to follow a strict diet in order to gain weight?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> While it's important to have a balanced and nutritious diet, you don't have to follow a strict diet plan in order to gain weight. Focus on consuming more calories than you burn, and make sure to include protein in your diet to help build muscle.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I lift weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It's recommended to lift weights at least 3-4 times a week. However, this can vary depending on your goals and schedule.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I gain weight without lifting weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> While lifting weights is one of the most effective ways to gain weight and build muscle, it's not the only way. You can also gain weight through consuming more calories than you burn, and incorporating other forms of exercise such as cardio or bodyweight exercises.</p><h2>Conclusion of Starting Lifting and Gaining Weight on Reddit</h2><p>Starting your journey towards gaining weight and building muscle can be intimidating, but with the support and guidance of the r/gainit community, you can achieve your goals. Remember to set realistic goals, track your progress, and stay consistent. With hard work and dedication, you can transform your body and gain the weight you always wanted.</p></article>
