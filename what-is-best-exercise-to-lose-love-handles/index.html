Sit on the ground with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.</p><p>2. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground, balancing on your sit bones.</p><p>3. Hold a weight or medicine ball with both hands and twist your torso to the right, then to the left.</p><p>4. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.</p><p><h2>Cardio Exercises for Love Handles</h2></p><p>Cardio exercises are also important for burning overall body fat, including love handles. Some effective cardio exercises include:</p><p>1. Running or jogging</p><p>2. Cycling</p><p>3. Swimming</p><p>4. High-intensity interval training (HIIT)</p><p>Choose the cardio exercise that you enjoy the most and can do consistently. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week or 75 minutes of high-intensity cardio per week.</p><p><h3>Additional Tips for Losing Love Handles</h3></p><p>In addition to strength training and cardio, there are some other tips that can help you lose love handles:</p><p>1.
