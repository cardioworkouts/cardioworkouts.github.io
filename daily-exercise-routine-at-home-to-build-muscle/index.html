This can include jogging in place, jumping jacks or push-ups. It's best to start with a low-intensity warm-up before moving on to more intense exercises. After warming up, you can focus on strength training exercises such as squats, lunges, push-ups, and pull-ups. Aim to perform 3-4 sets of each exercise with 8-12 repetitions per set.</p><p>In addition to strength training, it's important to include cardiovascular exercises in your daily exercise routine at home to build muscle.
