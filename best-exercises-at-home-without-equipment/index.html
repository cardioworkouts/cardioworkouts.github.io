Here&#039;s 20 No Equipment Workouts You Can Do At Home</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you someone who wants to stay fit and healthy but doesn't have the time or resources to hit the gym? Do you find yourself struggling to keep up with your fitness goals due to a busy schedule or a tight budget? We understand that finding the right exercises to do at home without any equipment can be challenging, but it's not impossible.</p><p>With the ongoing pandemic, people are spending more time indoors than ever before, which has resulted in a surge of people looking for ways to work out from home. However, not everyone has access to expensive gym equipment or the space to set up a home gym. This is where bodyweight exercises come in handy. </p><p>In this article, we'll discuss the best exercises you can do at home without any equipment. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced fitness enthusiast, these exercises will help you stay fit and healthy from the comfort of your own home.</p><p>Let's dive into the world of bodyweight exercises and explore the best exercises you can do at home without equipment.</p><h2>The Plank</h2><p>The plank is a great exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, including your core, shoulders, and back. It's a simple exercise that requires no equipment and can be done anywhere. </p><p>Personally, I started doing planks a few months ago, and I've already noticed a significant improvement in my core strength. To do a plank, start by getting into a push-up position, but instead of lowering your body down, hold your body in a straight line, with your forearms on the ground. Hold this position for as long as you can, making sure to keep your core tight and your back straight. </p><h2>Push-Ups</h2><p>Push-ups are another classic bodyweight exercise that targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps. They're a great exercise for building upper body strength and endurance. </p><p>I used to struggle with push-ups, but with consistent practice, I can now do several sets of push-ups without any trouble. To do a push-up, start in a plank position, with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down until your chest touches the ground, then push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat for as many reps as you can.</p><h3>Squats</h3><p>Squats are a fantastic exercise for building lower body strength and toning your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. They're a great way to get your heart rate up and burn calories without any equipment. </p><p>I've been doing squats for a while now, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my lower body strength and overall fitness level. To do a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your body down as if you're sitting in a chair. Make sure to keep your weight on your heels and your knees behind your toes. Stand back up to the starting position, and repeat for as many reps as you can.</p><h4>Lunges</h4><p>Lunges are another excellent exercise for building lower body strength and improving your balance and stability. They're a great way to target your glutes, quads, and hamstrings without any equipment. </p><p>I've been doing lunges for a while now, and they've helped me improve my lower body strength and balance. To do a lunge, start by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step forward with your right foot, and lower your body down until your right thigh is parallel to the ground. Make sure to keep your weight on your right heel and your left knee behind your toes. Push yourself back up to the starting position, and repeat on the other side.</p><h2>Conclusion of Best Exercises at Home Without Equipment</h2><p>Working out from home has never been easier. With these best exercises at home without equipment, you can stay fit and healthy without spending a dime on gym equipment or a gym membership. Start with these simple exercises, and gradually increase the intensity and duration to see the best results. Remember to stay consistent and make exercise a part of your daily routine. Happy exercising!</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q. How many reps should I do for each exercise?</strong></p><p>A. It depends on your fitness level and goals. Start with a few reps of each exercise, and gradually increase as you get stronger. Aim for 2-3 sets of each exercise, with 10-15 reps per set.</p><p><strong>Q. Can I do these exercises every day?</strong></p><p>A. Yes, you can do these exercises every day, but it's essential to give your body enough time to rest and recover. Aim for 2-3 days of exercise per week, and alternate between different exercises to avoid overworking the same muscle groups.</p><p><strong>Q. Can I modify these exercises if I have an injury?</strong></p><p>A. Yes, you can modify these exercises to suit your fitness level and any injuries you may have. For example, you can do knee push-ups instead of regular push-ups if you have wrist pain, or you can do box squats instead of regular squats if you have knee pain.</p><p><strong>Q. How long should I hold a plank for?</strong></p><p>A. Aim to hold a plank for at least 30 seconds to start with, and gradually increase the duration as you get stronger. Ideally, aim for 1-2 minutes of planking per day.</p></article>
