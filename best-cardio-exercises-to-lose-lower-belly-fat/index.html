I find that being in the water helps me feel more relaxed and less stressed. Additionally, swimming can be a great full-body workout, as it engages multiple muscle groups at once. To challenge myself, I like to mix up my swim routine by incorporating different strokes or using a kickboard.</p><p><h4>HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)</h4></p><p>HIIT is a type of cardio exercise that involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise, followed by periods of rest.
