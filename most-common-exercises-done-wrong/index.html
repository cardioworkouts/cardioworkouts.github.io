Are you feeling pain or discomfort after exercising? It might be because you're doing some of the most common exercises wrong. Don't worry, though - with a little bit of guidance, you can fix your form and get back on track towards your fitness goals.</p><p>Many people make mistakes when it comes to exercise form, and it can be discouraging when you're not seeing the results you want. But it's important to remember that form is crucial for both safety and effectiveness. By fixing your form, you can avoid injury and get the most out of your workouts.</p><p>In this tutorial, we'll go over the most common exercises done wrong and how to fix them. We'll cover exercises such as squats, push-ups, lunges, and more. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a better understanding of proper form and be on your way to achieving your fitness goals.</p><p>So let's get started! Here are the most common exercises done wrong and how to fix them:</p><h2>Squats</h2><p>Target: Legs, glutes</p><p>When I first started doing squats, I used to lean too far forward and put too much pressure on my knees. This is a common mistake, and it can lead to knee pain and injury. To fix this, make sure your weight is in your heels and your chest is up. Your knees should be in line with your toes, and you should be sitting back like you're sitting into a chair. Keep your core engaged and don't let your knees cave in.</p><h2>Push-Ups</h2><p>Target: Chest, triceps, shoulders</p><p>For a long time, I was doing push-ups with my elbows flared out to the sides. This puts unnecessary strain on your shoulders and can lead to injury. Instead, tuck your elbows in towards your sides and keep them at a 45-degree angle. This will engage your chest and triceps more effectively and reduce the risk of injury.</p><h2>Lunges</h2><p>Target: Legs, glutes</p><p>When I first started doing lunges, I used to lean too far forward and put too much pressure on my knees. This is a common mistake, and it can lead to knee pain and injury. To fix this, make sure your weight is evenly distributed between your front and back legs. Your front knee should be directly over your ankle, and your back knee should be hovering just above the ground. Keep your core engaged and don't let your front knee cave in.</p><h3>Deadlifts</h3><p>Target: Back, glutes, hamstrings</p><p>Deadlifts can be a great exercise, but they're often done wrong. One common mistake is rounding your back, which puts unnecessary strain on your spine. To fix this, hinge at your hips and keep your back straight. Your weight should be in your heels, and your chest should be up. Keep your shoulders back and engage your core to protect your back.</p><h4>Bicep Curls</h4><p>Target: Biceps</p><p>It's easy to cheat on bicep curls by swinging your arms, but this takes the focus away from your biceps and can lead to injury. To fix this, keep your elbows tucked in at your sides and curl the weight up slowly and with control. Focus on squeezing your bicep at the top of the movement, and lower the weight back down slowly.</p><h2>Conclusion of Most Common Exercises Done Wrong</h2><p>By fixing your form on these common exercises, you can avoid injury and get the most out of your workouts. Remember to keep your weight in your heels, engage your core, and focus on proper alignment. With a little bit of practice, you'll be on your way to achieving your fitness goals.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: Why is it important to have proper form when exercising?</h3><p>A: Proper form is important for both safety and effectiveness.
