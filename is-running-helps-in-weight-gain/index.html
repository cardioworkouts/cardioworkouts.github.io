Running is a popular form of exercise that is known to burn calories quickly. But does running help in weight gain? Let&#39;s find out.Running, in general, does not help in weight gain.

Running also helps in increasing the production of testosterone, which is a hormone that is responsible for building muscle mass.</p><h3>Importance of Proper Nutrition</h3><p>While running can indirectly contribute to weight gain by building muscle mass, it is essential to understand that nutrition plays a crucial role in weight gain. Proper nutrition is necessary to support muscle growth and repair. If you are not consuming enough calories, then your body will not have the energy and nutrients required to build muscle mass.</p><h4>Tips to Gain Weight through Running</h4><p>If you want to gain weight through running, then you need to follow a proper nutrition plan. Here are some tips that can help you gain weight while running:</p><ol><li>Consume more calories than you burn</li><li>Eat a balanced diet with complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats</li><li>Include strength training exercises in your workout routine</li><li>Stay consistent with your running and nutrition plan</li></ol><h2>Personal Experience</h2><p>When I started following a proper nutrition plan and incorporating strength training exercises into my workout routine, I noticed a significant change in my body composition.
