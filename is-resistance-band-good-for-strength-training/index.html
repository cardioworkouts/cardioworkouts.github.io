Squats</h3><p>Stand on the resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the handles of the band at shoulder height, with your palms facing forward. Lower your body into a squat position, keeping your back straight and your knees over your toes. As you stand up, pull the handles up towards your shoulders, squeezing your shoulder blades together.</p><h4>2. Chest Press</h4><p>Anchor the resistance band to a sturdy object, such as a door or wall. Hold the handles of the band at chest height, with your palms facing forward. Step forward to create tension in the band. Push the handles forward, extending your arms in front of you. Slowly release and return to the starting position.</p><h2>3. Bicep Curls</h2><p>Stand on the resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the handles of the band at your sides, with your palms facing forward. Keeping your elbows close to your sides, curl the handles up towards your shoulders. Slowly release and return to the starting position.</p><p><h2>FAQs</h2></p><h3>Q1.
