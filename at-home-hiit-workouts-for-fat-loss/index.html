You can choose any exercise you like, such as squats, push-ups, or jumping jacks.</p><p>Personally, I like to do a Tabata workout with bodyweight exercises such as burpees, mountain climbers, and jumping lunges. These exercises don't require any equipment and can be done anywhere, making it the perfect at home workout.</p><p><h2>HIIT Workout #2: EMOM</h2></p><p>EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute) is another popular HIIT workout that involves doing a set number of reps of an exercise at the beginning of every minute. The remaining time in the minute is used for rest. You can choose any exercise you like, such as kettlebell swings, push-ups, or dumbbell squats.</p><p>Personally, I like to do an EMOM workout with kettlebell swings. I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and do 10 reps of kettlebell swings at the beginning of each minute. The remaining time in the minute is used for rest. This workout is quick and effective, and I can feel my heart rate increase with each round.</p><p><h3>How to Implement At Home HIIT Workouts for Fat Loss?</h3></p><p>When implementing at home HIIT workouts for fat loss, it's important to start slow and gradually increase the intensity.

Don't push yourself too hard at the beginning, and remember to listen to your body. If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop the workout immediately.</p><p><h4>Tips for Effective At Home HIIT Workouts for Fat Loss</h4></p><p>1. Warm up properly before each workout<br> 2.
