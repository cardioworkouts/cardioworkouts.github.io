You are not alone! Many beginners struggle with this question, and it can be overwhelming to navigate the information available on the internet. In this article, we will guide you through how much cardio after weight training reddit and provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision.</p><h2>Pain Points of How Much Cardio After Weight Training Reddit</h2><p>One of the main pain points associated with how much cardio after weight training reddit is the fear of losing muscle mass. Many people believe that doing cardio after weight training will burn their hard-earned muscles. Another pain point is the confusion around how much cardio is enough and how much is too much. Some people worry that they are not doing enough cardio to see results, while others are concerned that they are doing too much and risking injury or burnout.</p><h2>Answer to How Much Cardio After Weight Training Reddit</h2><p>The answer to how much cardio after weight training reddit depends on your fitness goals. If your goal is to build muscle mass, it is recommended that you do no more than 20-30 minutes of cardio after weight training. This will help improve your cardiovascular health without compromising your muscle gains. On the other hand, if your goal is to lose weight, you may need to do more cardio. It is recommended that you do 30-60 minutes of cardio after weight training to see significant weight loss results.</p><p>It is essential to listen to your body and adjust your cardio accordingly. If you feel exhausted after weight training, it is okay to skip cardio or do a shorter session.
