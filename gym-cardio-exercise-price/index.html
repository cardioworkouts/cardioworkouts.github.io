This will help determine what type of membership or exercise equipment is feasible. There are a variety of gym membership options available, ranging from basic to premium.

From basic to premium, there were a variety of choices to consider. After doing some research, I decided to go with a basic membership that included access to cardio equipment. While I miss having access to group fitness classes and personal training sessions, I'm happy with my decision because it fits within my budget.</p><p>When considering gym membership prices, it's important to read the fine print. Some gyms may require a contract or initiation fee, while others may offer discounts for paying upfront or signing up for a longer term membership.

Treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes can easily cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. While these machines may offer a great workout, they may not be feasible for those on a tight budget.</p><p>Instead, I opted for more affordable options such as resistance bands, jump ropes, and exercise balls.

Additionally, they're portable and easy to store, making them a great option for those with limited space.</p><p><h3>Alternative Cardio Exercise Options</h3></p><p>For those who don't want to invest in gym memberships or home gym equipment, there are a variety of alternative cardio exercise options available.
