First, it's important to start slowly and use proper form to avoid injury. Additionally, it's a good idea to work with a certified personal trainer or fitness professional who can help you create a safe and effective workout plan.</p><p>Another tip is to vary your workouts to avoid plateaus and keep your muscles guessing.
